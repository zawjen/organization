## Introduction

In a word, our vision is to spread ‘Sincerity‘ around the globe.

In a few words, we want to spread Charity, Support, Love, Knowledge, Words, and Light.

‘زوجین’ is an Arabic word meaning ‘Pair’. We deal with pairs, like Truth and Lie, Reality and Illusion, Honesty and Deception, Knowledge and Ignorance, and many more like:

Good and Evil  
Right and Wrong  
Justice and Injustice  
Wisdom and Ignorance  
Honesty and Deception  
Strength and Weakness  
Knowledge and Ignorance  
Order and Chaos  
Love and Hate  
Faith and Doubt  
Peace and War  
Success and Failure  
Virtue and Vice

زوجین التوحید means ‘Pair of Oneness’. Or the Pairs that help us understand Oneness or our true God i.e. Allah.

## Words

We deal with words at [Zawjen.net](https://zawjen.net/). Our mobile, and web applications, media efforts, study tours, and charity and support efforts help you to understand the meaning of words.

A word can fall into several Categories, including but not limited to the following:

People, Places, Fruits, Animals, Birds, Angels, Jinn, Events, Miracles, Laws, Ethics, Historical Stories, Natural Elements, Religious Concepts, Spiritual Terms, Rivers, Mountains, Cities, Countries, Tribes, Prophets, Kings, Teachings, Punishments, Prayers, Charity, Fasting, Worship, Heaven, Hell, Creation, Commandments, Signs of God, Resurrection, Judgment Day, Wisdom, Parables, Metaphors, Symbols, Blessings, Punishments, Divine Revelation, Prophecies, Covenant, Sin, Repentance, Forgiveness, Mercy, Justice, Light, Darkness, Good, Evil, Truth, Falsehood, War, Peace, Love, Patience, Gratitude, Humility, Pride, Hypocrisy, Faith, Knowledge, Guidance, Struggle, Trials, Tests, Success, Failure, Sacrifice, Obedience, Disobedience, Leadership, Kingdoms, Nations, Holy Books, Sacred Sites, Prayer Locations, Idolatry, Righteousness, Piety, Brotherhood, Family, Marriage, Inheritance, Trade, Economy, Wealth, Poverty, Orphans, Widows, Charity, Bribery, Oppression, Liberation, Slavery, Free Will, Destiny, Signs of the End Times, Angels’ Duties, Divine Messages, Sacred Language, Poetry, Songs, Divine Punishments, Healing, Resurrection of the Dead, Afterlife, Intercession, Divine Wisdom, Divine Commands.

## Sentences

Words form a sentence. We classify sentences as:

1. Truth – Green  
2. Lie – Red  
3. Doubtful – Yellow

We want to know what is Green or a Truth, what is Red or a Lie and what is Yellow or Doubtful. We wish to help humanity to know the Truth.

## Our Focus

Our efforts will focus on the following ideas:

1. Study in Nature  
2. Share Knowledge & Love  
3. Share Green Knowledge  
4. Green Content for Kids, Adults & Elderly  
5. Create Millions of Green Datasets

   ## Focus Details

3. Green Content for Kids, Adults & Elderly  
   We will build Green content loved by various age groups, genders, and communities around the world.
