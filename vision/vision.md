## Zawjen Vision

In a word, our vision is to spread ‘Sincerity‘ around the globe.

In a few words, we want to spread Charity, Support, Love, Knowledge, Words, and Light.

Zawjen is **not** a technical project. It is on a mission to spread the  `sincerity` of the Quran. Zawjen leadership and governance practices should be aligned with the principle of `sincerity` as established by the Quran. The principle of `sincerity` is loud and clear **"Indeed, those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabians---those (among them) who believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteousness---will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve."** (Quran 2:62)

‘زوجین’ is an Arabic word meaning ‘Pair’. We deal with pairs, like Truth and Lie, Reality and Illusion, Honesty and Deception, Knowledge and Ignorance, and many more like:

Good and Evil  
Right and Wrong  
Justice and Injustice  
Wisdom and Ignorance  
Honesty and Deception  
Strength and Weakness  
Knowledge and Ignorance  
Order and Chaos  
Love and Hate  
Faith and Doubt  
Peace and War  
Success and Failure  
Virtue and Vice

زوجین التوحید means ‘Pair of Oneness’. Or the Pairs that help us understand Oneness or our true God i.e. Allah.

## Words

We deal with words at [Zawjen.net](https://zawjen.net/). Our mobile, and web applications, media efforts, study tours, and charity and support efforts help you to understand the meaning of words.

A word can fall into several Categories, including but not limited to the following:

People, Places, Fruits, Animals, Birds, Angels, Jinn, Events, Miracles, Laws, Ethics, Historical Stories, Natural Elements, Religious Concepts, Spiritual Terms, Rivers, Mountains, Cities, Countries, Tribes, Prophets, Kings, Teachings, Punishments, Prayers, Charity, Fasting, Worship, Heaven, Hell, Creation, Commandments, Signs of God, Resurrection, Judgment Day, Wisdom, Parables, Metaphors, Symbols, Blessings, Punishments, Divine Revelation, Prophecies, Covenant, Sin, Repentance, Forgiveness, Mercy, Justice, Light, Darkness, Good, Evil, Truth, Falsehood, War, Peace, Love, Patience, Gratitude, Humility, Pride, Hypocrisy, Faith, Knowledge, Guidance, Struggle, Trials, Tests, Success, Failure, Sacrifice, Obedience, Disobedience, Leadership, Kingdoms, Nations, Holy Books, Sacred Sites, Prayer Locations, Idolatry, Righteousness, Piety, Brotherhood, Family, Marriage, Inheritance, Trade, Economy, Wealth, Poverty, Orphans, Widows, Charity, Bribery, Oppression, Liberation, Slavery, Free Will, Destiny, Signs of the End Times, Angels’ Duties, Divine Messages, Sacred Language, Poetry, Songs, Divine Punishments, Healing, Resurrection of the Dead, Afterlife, Intercession, Divine Wisdom, Divine Commands.

So, if for example, a word is about a Person, then a Person could have any of the following attributes and we do evidence-based research to find these attributes:

## Sentences

Words form a sentence. We classify sentences as:

1. Truth – Green

3. Doubtful – Yellow

We want to know what is Green or a Truth, what is Red or a Lie and what is Yellow or Doubtful. We wish to help humanity to know the Truth.
