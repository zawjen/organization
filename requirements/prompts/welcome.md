## Backend Services
---
### REST Service
We have to build [your-service-name] using NestJS which will be called by NextJs website and ReactNative mobile app. We are using Kong API Gateway which will be used as a gateway to access [your-service-name] from mobile or website. Kong API Gateway or [your-service-name] has to authenticate user using Keycloak.

Write a step by step process document for developer to create [your-service-name], deployed behind Kong API Gateway using Docker and Kubernetes.

Kong API Gateway should be configured to authenticate request using Keycloak.

The [your-service-name] should have a setting 'SERVICE-DOWN', which if set to true will return sample JSON from sample.json file.

Write endpoints for following features:

1- [endpoint 1]: This will return list of datasets
2- [endpoint 2]: This will post a dataset json to save

Create a NextJS and ReactNative forms to call [your-service-name].

[your-service-name] is only be authorized to be called from
1- NextJS website web-zawjen 
2- ReactNative mobile app mob-zawjen 
3- microservices dataset-service 

All other requests must be denied as they are DDoS attacks. 
Add necessary details so [your-service-name] stays highly secure and must be on SSL

### CLI
#### Scrapper CLI
Write detailed [Scrapper CLI] requirements document for a developer. Write code for each Python class, complete functionality and its unit tests using pytest mentioned below. Follow all instructions below. Do not skip any requirement below.

The CLI built using following tech stack

Feature Details
- All classes must be under sdk folder
- Program should start from main.py
- A command line argument class CliArgs that accepts following arguments. Create a table in document.
    - --download-folder: Optional Location to download scrapped website
    - --url: Required comma separated list of Url of websites to download
    - --threads: Optional number of concurrent threads to be used for scrapping. Default is 5
- Time spend on important or long running steps should be logged using a logger class which will have log(self, message, start_time) to calculate time_spent
- if download-folder is specified, use that folder to save scrapped files. Create folder if it does not exists
- A Downloader class to download from specified urls in multithreaded way. Respect the websiteâ€™s robots.txt file and make sure not to overload the server with thread more than specified in robots.txt of website. 
- Each link of every page should be downloaded, possibly in a separate thread as specified in argument --threads. If --threads is not specified, the default should be 5 or less than or equal to specified in robots.txt
- Once the page is downloaded, JsonConverter class should be called. It should find class to call to convert HtmlToJson using switch case on page Url. So, for page url www.xyz.com/page1.html, start a thread of a class and call class JsonXyz with page url.
