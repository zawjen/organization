# grpc-secret-manager-service

Please generate requirements document using [prompts](../../supporting/prompts/services.md)

As our repositories are open to world, do not ðŸš« save passwords, username and other secret information in repository files.

I will create a service ticket for secret-manager-service based on  https://github.com/hashicorp/vault which our backend service will use to store and retrieve secrets for dev, qa, prodÂ environments
