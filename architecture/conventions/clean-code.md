# Clean Coding Principles and Guidelines

## Introduction
Clean code is the foundation of maintainable, scalable, and efficient software development. This document outlines best practices for writing clean, readable, and structured code across mobile, web, and microservices using Next.js, NestJS, Python, and TypeScript.

## General Clean Coding Principles
1. **Readable Code**: Write code that is easy to understand for humans first, then machines.
2. **Consistency**: Follow a uniform coding style throughout the project.
3. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A function or class should have only one reason to change.
4. **Avoid Deep Nesting**: Use early returns and guard clauses to reduce indentation levels.
5. **Meaningful Naming**: Use descriptive variable, function, and class names.
6. **Code Comments**: Add meaningful comments only where necessary; avoid redundant comments.
7. **Keep Functions Small**: A function should do one thing and do it well.
8. **Avoid Magic Numbers and Strings**: Define constants instead.
9. **Follow DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication by reusing functions and modules.
10. **Write Testable Code**: Ensure the code is easy to unit test and integrate with automated testing.
11. **Follow zawjen.net coding convention**.
12. **Write 100% coverage unit tests**: Ensure every function and module is covered with unit tests to prevent regressions and improve maintainability.
13. **Ensure the solution is highly performant, low on memory, CPU, and battery usage**: Optimize queries, reduce computations, and minimize unnecessary rendering or background processes.
14. **Ensure the solution is highly scalable and maintainable**: Use modular architecture, design patterns, and efficient resource management to support future growth and changes.
15. **Follow zawjen.net clean coding principles**.
16. **Use try-catch and log errors**: Always handle exceptions gracefully and log errors for debugging and monitoring.

## Next.js Guidelines (Frontend)
1. **Component Structure**:
   - Use functional components.
   - Separate concerns: avoid mixing logic and UI.
   - Utilize React hooks effectively.
   
2. **State Management**:
   - Use React Context or Zustand for global state management.
   - Prefer local state over global state when possible.
   
3. **API Handling**:
   - Use SWR or React Query for data fetching.
   - Centralize API calls in a single utility file.

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Use memoization (`useMemo`, `useCallback`) to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
   - Optimize images using Next.js Image component.
   - Implement lazy loading for components when necessary.

5. **Routing**:
   - Follow Next.js app router best practices.
   - Use dynamic routes for scalability.
   
6. **Security**:
   - Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
   - Implement authentication using NextAuth.js or JWT.

## NestJS Guidelines (Backend)
1. **Modular Structure**:
   - Organize the project into modules for separation of concerns.
   - Each module should handle only one specific feature.

2. **Controller, Service, and Repository Pattern**:
   - Controllers handle HTTP requests and responses.
   - Services contain business logic.
   - Repositories interact with the database.

3. **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**:
   - Use DTOs to enforce type safety in request and response payloads.
   
4. **Middleware & Guards**:
   - Use middleware for logging and request transformation.
   - Implement guards for authentication and role-based access control.

5. **Exception Handling**:
   - Use NestJS `ExceptionFilter` for consistent error handling.
   - Implement global error handling middleware.
   - Use try-catch blocks and log errors for debugging and monitoring.

6. **Database Best Practices**:
   - Use TypeORM or Prisma with NestJS.
   - Keep migration and schema files under version control.

## Python Guidelines (Microservices & AI Services)
1. **Code Structure**:
   - Follow PEP 8 for coding conventions.
   - Organize modules into meaningful directories.
   - Use virtual environments for dependency management.
   
2. **Logging & Monitoring**:
   - Use `logging` module instead of print statements.
   - Implement centralized logging with structured logs.
   - Use try-catch blocks and log errors effectively.

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Use asynchronous programming with `asyncio` where necessary.
   - Optimize loops and avoid unnecessary computations.

4. **Security Best Practices**:
   - Use environment variables for secret management.
   - Validate and sanitize user inputs.

5. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests using `pytest`.
   - Ensure 100% code coverage.

## TypeScript Best Practices
1. **Type Safety**:
   - Always define types/interfaces.
   - Avoid using `any` unless necessary.

2. **Strict Mode**:
   - Enable `strict` mode in `tsconfig.json`.

3. **Avoid Complex Types**:
   - Use union and intersection types wisely.
   - Prefer composition over inheritance.

4. **Code Reusability**:
   - Use utility types and generic functions to make reusable components.

5. **Avoid `null` and `undefined` Handling Issues**:
   - Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`).

## Additional Best Practices
1. **Git & Version Control**:
   - Follow a consistent branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow).
   - Write clear and concise commit messages.
   - Use `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files.

2. **Documentation**:
   - Use JSDoc or Python docstrings for documenting functions.
   - Maintain an updated README.md with setup and usage instructions.

3. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Automate testing and deployments.
   - Use tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or CircleCI.

4. **Code Reviews**:
   - Follow a pull-request-based workflow.
   - Ensure each PR is reviewed before merging.

5. **Linting & Formatting**:
   - Use ESLint and Prettier for JavaScript/TypeScript.
   - Use Black and Flake8 for Python.
   - Enforce linting rules in CI/CD pipelines.

## Conclusion
Following these clean coding principles and best practices will result in high-quality, maintainable, and scalable software. Consistency, readability, and proper structure are key to ensuring long-term project success. Always strive for simplicity, clarity, and efficiency in your code.
