At **Zawjen** we will follow some of practices in open-source teams like **Linux, Node.js, and other major projects** rely on well-structured processes to manage tasks, plan features, and ensure quality, even with contributors working asynchronously across the globe. Hereâ€™s how they handle it:

### **1. Assigning Tasks & Managing Tickets**
- **Issue Trackers:** Projects use GitHub Issues, GitLab Issues, or JIRA to track tasks, bug reports, and feature requests.
- **Tagging & Categorization:** Issues are labeled as "bug," "enhancement," "good first issue," etc., helping contributors find tasks that match their skills.
- **Self-Assignment:** Many open-source projects work on a volunteer basis, meaning developers **pick issues** they want to work on rather than being assigned.
- **Maintainers' Role:** Core maintainers oversee priorities, review code, and sometimes actively assign tasks to trusted contributors.

### **2. Building Requirements**
- **RFC (Request for Comments) Process:** For major changes, contributors write detailed proposals (RFCs) outlining the problem, solution, and impact.
- **Discussion on GitHub/GitLab & Mailing Lists:** Features are discussed in-depth before implementation in issues, pull requests (PRs), and developer mailing lists.
- **Working Groups:** Some projects (e.g., Node.js) have working groups dedicated to specific areas (security, performance, etc.), which define requirements for those domains.
- **Roadmaps & Milestones:** Large projects maintain **roadmaps** that highlight upcoming features and **milestones** that group issues into planned releases.

### **3. Ensuring Testing & Code Quality**
- **Automated Testing (CI/CD):** 
  - Every pull request is checked by Continuous Integration (CI) tools like **GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or Jenkins**.
  - Tests include **unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks**.
- **Code Review Process:**
  - Every change goes through a **pull request (PR) review**.
  - Maintainers and experienced contributors **approve, request changes, or reject** code.
- **Linting & Static Analysis:** Tools like **ESLint, Prettier, Clang-Tidy** enforce coding standards.
- **Beta Releases & Community Testing:** Large projects release **alpha/beta versions** and encourage the community to test.

### **4. Managing Asynchronous Contributions**
- **No Fixed Work Hours:** Contributors work at their own pace, but the **core team ensures progress by merging small incremental changes**.
- **Documentation & Issue Discussion:** Clear documentation ensures that even those who return after months can catch up.
- **Sprints & Releases:** Some projects adopt agile-like iterations, while others release versions based on stability rather than time.

### **5. Long-Term Planning & Governance**
- **Core Team & Maintainers:** A small group of experienced developers guides the project.
- **Community Meetings & Summits:** Some projects have scheduled virtual meetings or annual developer conferences.
- **Open Governance Models:** 
  - **Linux Kernel:** Maintainers at different levels manage subsystems, Linus Torvalds has the final say.
  - **Node.js:** Uses a Technical Steering Committee (TSC) with democratic decision-making.
