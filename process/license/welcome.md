# Zawjen.net Apache 2.0 Protects Against Patent-Related Legal Issues 

The [Apache 2.0 License](../../LICENSE) includes a built-in **patent grant**, which protects **you and other users** from patent-related legal problems. See also [Contribution Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) Here’s how it works:  

---

## 🔹 **1. Prevents Contributors from Suing Users Over Patents**  
When someone contributes code to **Zawjen.net** under Apache 2.0, they **automatically grant** a **royalty-free, worldwide, irrevocable patent license** to anyone using the project.  

✅ This means that **if a contributor owns a patent related to their code, they cannot later sue users** of Zawjen.net for patent infringement.  

### **Example:**
- A developer contributes an advanced **AI-based filtering system** to Zawjen.net.
- Later, they **get a patent** on that system.
- Because of Apache 2.0, they **cannot sue users of Zawjen.net** for using that system.

---

## 🔹 **2. Protects Against Future Patent Lawsuits (Retaliation Clause)**  
Apache 2.0 has a **patent retaliation clause**:  

**If someone using Zawjen.net sues others for patent infringement related to the software, they automatically lose their license to use it.**  

### **Example:**
- A company uses Zawjen.net in their website.
- Later, they sue another company claiming **"this code violates our patent!"**
- Because they initiated a patent lawsuit, **they lose the right to use Zawjen.net** under Apache 2.0.

---

## 🔹 **3. Ensures Long-Term Open Source Protection**  
Because the license is **irrevocable**, once someone contributes code under Apache 2.0, **they cannot later revoke the patent rights**.  

✅ **This ensures that Zawjen.net will always remain open-source and legally safe to use.**  

---

### **🔒 Why This Matters for Zawjen.net?**
1️⃣ **Prevents patent trolls** – No one can patent a feature of Zawjen.net and then sue users.  
2️⃣ **Encourages contributions** – Developers know they are legally protected.  
3️⃣ **Protects users** – Anyone using Zawjen.net is safe from patent lawsuits related to its code.  

✅ **With Apache 2.0, Zawjen.net is legally secure, both for developers and users.** 🚀
