# Zawjen Blog Writing Process

To cultivate `Sincerity`, we encourage everyone at zawjen to write small 1 minute blog posts for `https://zawjen.net/blog/` and `canva` videos for Zawjen youtube channel `https://www.youtube.com/@Zawjen`

- Create a folder `year`/`month`/`day` under repository `https://github.com/zawjen/blog/`, e.g. `2025`/`03`/`01`
- Create a `.md` file for blog post e.g. `conscious-sincerity.md`
- Paste the blog post
- Create an image using WhatsApp `Meta`
  - Open WhatsApp
  - Select `Meta` tab or icon. Currently the icon is a `blue circle`
  - Type suitable image prompt that encourages sincerity, paradise and charity `/imagine conscious sincerity with rewards in paradise while sun set and a path to paradise` 
  - You can type `one more` in `Meta` to generate one more image
  - If you are satisfied with the image, download and shrink its size using `https://tinypng.com`
- Now copy the compressed image to blog post folder `year`/`month`/`day` created previously
- To review and post blog post, send a WhatsApp message with link to your blog post in `blog` repository to 
  - `Rafey` or 
  - `zawjen.net` website admins
